This is a chat server I made where a user can send messages to other users and have it encrypted using RSA and 1 of 2 different cipher types (Add128 or Substitute) which is "randomnly" chosen per user.

In order to run file two different command lines must be run one to compile the server file and one to compile the chat client.

It will prompt you for a user name and the server name (for server name type in localhost). Enjoy the security!
